# form-Validation

Welcome to the Simple Form Validation Project! This project demonstrates basic form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Features

- Validate form inputs for accuracy and completeness.
- Display user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.
- Prevent submission of the form until all required fields are filled correctly.

## Usage

1. Open the webpage in your browser by navigating to the provided URL : https://ritwik214.github.io/form-Validation/.
2. Fill out the form by providing information in each field.
3. As you type, observe the real-time validation feedback for each input field:
   - Invalid inputs will trigger error messages beneath the respective fields.
   - Valid inputs will be indicated with a success indicator.
4. Once all required fields are filled correctly, the form can be successfully submitted.
5. If any required fields are left empty or contain invalid data, the form will not submit. Instead, error messages will guide you to correct the issues.
6. Feel free to test various scenarios, such as leaving fields empty, entering incorrect formats, or attempting to submit without meeting validation criteria.

The Simple Form Validation Project emphasizes the importance of accurate and complete data entry. By providing immediate feedback and user-friendly error messages, the project helps users submit valid information while ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience.
